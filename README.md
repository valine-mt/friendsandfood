# Friends & Food

Description
-----------------
This is a simple social media app that allow you to privately share cooking recipes with others.

I created this app because my siblings and I like to share recipes via texts which isn't ideal for finding the recipes we need, later on.

It is meant for **DEMO ONLY** and to be run locally (see Usage Section).

Built with
-----------------
- Node JS
- Express JS (& Express Generator)
- Jade for rendering HTML/CSS files on browser, from server side
- CSV files (as DB)

Installation
-----------------
1. Prerequisite - To use this app, you'll need the following
   1. Node JS installed
   2. Express JS installed
   3. Multer JS installed (Node middleware for handling file uploads)
2. Run the app on terminal (cmd node app.js)
3. Open the app on any browser, the port is 3000 (localhost:3000)

Usage
-----------------
This app is meant for **DEMO ONLY** and to be run locally.

It is **not secure**. You might also want to plug the app to a real database (instead of CSV files) for actual usage etc.
